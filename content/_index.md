ðŸ‘‹ yo.

I'm a software engineer with experience in backend feature and API development, data pipelines for ML, developer productivity, and infrastructure management (Kubernetes). I work best when given an ideal outcome and the autonomy to figure out the details.

I have a lot of opinions about reliability, organizational sustainability, and code health. I love spreadsheets and diagrams as storytelling tools.

Currently, I'm based in SF working at a stealth startup!
