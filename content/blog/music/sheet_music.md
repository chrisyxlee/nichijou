Sheets at the bottom.

I have a tough relationship with music. I used to make arrangements and upload piano covers to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/chris3169512) from when I was 13 to 18 years old. I stopped after I went to college, but I worked hard on the sheets and want them to still be available.

Playing piano is (was?) fun for me, but making arrangements and transcribing was never natural to me. I have relative pitch and barely at that, so I'd spend 5 hours consecutively replaying the same notes for a 1m30s song. As I got older and gained more hobbies... I basically [KonMari'd](https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/) my life. If I have 5 hours now, would I spend all that time playing piano? Honestly... probably not.

I still look back fondly at that time, but I'm finally at a point where I can admit to myself --  I probably won't play piano consistently ever again.

But anyways, the sheet music my friends (losttuna and [Nos0323](https://youtube.com/nos0323)) and I have made are here!
